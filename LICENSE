# ePayment v1.0 for Laravel 5

## Laravel

After updating composer, add the PackageServiceProvider to the providers array in `config/app.php`

    CuongHuynh\EasyPay2\PackageServiceProvider::class,

You can optionally use the facade for shorter code. Add this to your facades:

    'EasyPay2' => CuongHuynh\EasyPay2\Facades\EasyPay2Facade::class

Publish the config-file.

    php artisan vendor:publish

You will have `epayment.php` in config folder
